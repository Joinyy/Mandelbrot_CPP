# Mandelbrot_CPP
Aim: Mandelbrot with big floating point precision, fast executing time and multi platform.

## Commands:

| Key | Command |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| `Esc` | Close program. |
| `D` | Show debug messages in the upper left corner. |
| `P` | Show mouse position in the upper left corner. |
| `C` | Change colormap. |
| `I` | Change max iterations. |
| `Mousewheel Up` | Zoom in to the current mouse position. |
| `Mousewheel Down` | Zoom out TO (yes to, atm) the current mouse position. |


## Upcoming features
(When I find some time)

- Zoom out FROM the current mouse position
- Make the colormaps smoother for nicer results
- `boost::multiprecision` implementation of all floating point variables in the mandelbrot set
- \*nix compatibility and makefile

#### Maybes:
- nVidia CUDA for parallel execution of the mandelbrot set calculation
